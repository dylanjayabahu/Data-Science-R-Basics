# <- is the assignment symbol (= is also usable, but <- is preferred)

a #we can see the what is in a
print(a) # we can also print the value of a (basically same as above but more explicit)

# objects are anything stored in r, e.g. variables

ls() # shows all the objects in the workspace (also shown in top right global environment pane)
